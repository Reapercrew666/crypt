[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Filter Results by Size[/B][/COLOR]
[I]Fen allows you to filter results by their size.

To [B]filter[/B] torrents by size, enable: Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering->Filter Results by Size. Default is disabled.

When filtering by size, you can set a minimum and maximum size for both Movies and Episodes. You input the values yourself, and they are used by Fen as GB's.

e.g. If you want minimum size for Movies to be 2.5GB, you would input "2.5". If you want 5GB minimum, you could input "5" or "5.0". If you want Episodes minimum to be 756MB you would input "0.756".
