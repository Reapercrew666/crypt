[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Backup Fen User Data[/B][/COLOR]
[I]NOTE: To use Backup, you must have a folder set for the backup to be written to. You can use a folder on the same machine, or a folder on your LAN network. Go to Settings->General->Backup/Restore to set the folder.

Fen allows you to backup and restore the contents of your Fen userdata folder. This folder contains Fen's settings and databases. After a backup folder location has been set, navigate to Tools->Backup/Restore Fen User Data to access the backup and restore functions. When you select Backup, you will be given the option of what you wish to backup: "Settings" will backup the settings.xml file, "Database Files" will backup all of Fen's database files.[/I]
